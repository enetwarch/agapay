# Agapay

This is a mobile e-wallet app coded in as a website. Just like `[hau-campus-erp](https://github.com/enetwarch/hau-campus-erp)`, it is not a school requirement but it is done for practice. The website is also deployed on [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/) for the [live demo](https://enetwarch.github.io/agapay).

### Tech Stack

**All of the technology used in this project is front-end**. As this is just a mock rework, there will be no backend that will deal with authentication, databases, API, etc.. **No frameworks or libraries were used**, meaning all of this is made from vanilla web development languages.

* **HTML5**: For the semantic structure of the website.
* **CSS3**: Styles the HTML to make it look more modern and to increase UI and UX experience.
* **JavaScript**: Heavy use of JavaScript and ES6 modules, especially for form validation and modals.
